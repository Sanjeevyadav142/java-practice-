# Java Variables Practice

This project contains basic Java programs demonstrating:
1. Declaring and initializing variables of all primitive data types.
2. Swapping two numbers using a third variable.
3. Calculating the area of a rectangle.
4. Understanding what happens if a variable is declared but not initialized.

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Primitive Data Types in Java: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`
- Variable declaration and initialization
- Swapping values
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Default values of variables

## 📝 Programs

### 1.important thing in Variables Declaration & Initialization
-By default, any whole number you type without a suffix (like 1000) is treated as an int (32-bit integer).
-If the value is within the range of int (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647), Java will allow it without
 a suffix — even if you assign it to a long
